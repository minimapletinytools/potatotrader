:: TODO TMRW::
DONE-check that it actually worked ^
DONE-add < 0 bounds into arbitrage
-add logging to arbitrage
-add routine that runs arbitrage every now and then
DONE-force exchange rate on uniswap and see if that changes profit
DONE-add tx fees to Chain exchange
DONE-fix the order pricing issue in Bilaxy.Exchange (using avg price, not lowest/highest price)
  -it would actually be best if it submit several orders instead of 1 at the lowest/highest price for safety


::TODO::
-add test cases for all the chain query stuff D:
  DONE-merge testfixture branch
-fix decimal conversion in bilaxy exchange when posting orders
-test flipExchange
DONE-reorg to give everything a package name
DONE-Potato.Trading
DONE-check if bilaxy is actually using bilaxy tokens to pay for txfees
IGNORE-figure out if txfees are levied in first or second token on bilaxy
DONE- Create `data FlipExchange e = FlipExchange e`
  -I'm pretty sure this is doable, just don't mess up buy/sell differences and do proper conversion for ExchangeRate functions
IGNORE-add account abstracted version of some stuff in Chain and Bilaxy query (this is just in prep for using ExchangeAccount. We won't switch all the way over yet)
DONE-add monadic abstraction for some methods in chain and bilaxy query (also in preparation)
IGNORE-write tests to ascertain units and exchange rate stuff is done correctly
  -i.e. write test cases for make_buyt1 and make_sell1t
  -for chain tests you can query the uniswap contract (and a block number) and run locally with the same numbers to ensure result is the same :D

::FUTURE::
- accounts should not be read in IO monad. They should be passed in as an argument for each private exchange function (using data family for type)
- add mock interfaces for all IO monad calls for testing instead of actually querying exchanges...
